**Gherkin Auto-Complete Plus has been updated to version 1.2.1**

Changes
=======


* Added support for the keyword `*`. When this keyword is used, it will be
  available for all step-types (`Given`, `When`, `Then`). Conversely, all
  steps will be available in the suggestions when the line starts with `*`.
