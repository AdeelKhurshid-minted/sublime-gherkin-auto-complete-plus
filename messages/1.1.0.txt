**Gherkin Auto-Complete Plus has been updated to version 1.1.0**

Changes
=======

* The package no longer checks if you're in the provided Gherkin syntax to update steps. Instead, it verifies that you are in a `*.feature` file. (thanks @Asuza)

* Logging has been added. You can now specify a logging level to get info about the package as it's running. The default is ERROR, which will only output the the Sublime Text console if an error occurs.
