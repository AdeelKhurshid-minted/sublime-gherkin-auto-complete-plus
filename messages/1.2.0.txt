**Gherkin Auto-Complete Plus has been updated to version 1.2.0**

Changes
=======

* There is a new Sublime Text command for fuzzy-searching through the catalogued
  auto-complete suggestions.

* It is no longer necessary to specify the feature file directories explicitly.
  Any folders open in Sublime Text will be searched recursively for `*.feature`
  filesThis will help users that have more than one project with Gherkin steps.
  This way, steps from a different project won't pollute the auto-complete list.
  (NOTE: additional directories can be specified via the `feature_file_directories`
  option).

* For large projects where recursively checking the filetree for `*.feature` files
  would cause poor performance, there is an `ignore_open_directories` option. If this
  option is selected, only the directories in the `feature_file_directories` will
  be scanned.
